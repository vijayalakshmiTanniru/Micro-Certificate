Build a micro-certification platform where students can attempt small quizzes (MCQs), view their results instantly, and download a certificate with their name and score. This will be a mini version of a certification engine that can later be integrated into the AGH LMS. 
Requirements 
Frontend (React) 
● Quiz interface (question by question with options). 
● Result screen with score and pass/fail status. 
● Button to generate & download certificates. 
Backend (Node.js + Express) 
● API to fetch quiz questions. 
● API to validate answers and calculate results. 
● API to trigger certificate generation. 
Database (MongoDB / SQL) 
● Users: id, name, email. 
● Questions: id, quizId, questionText, options\[], correctAnswer. ● Results: id, userId, quizId, score, date. 
Feature 
Auto-generate PDF Certificate with the student's name, quiz title, and score. Acceptance Criteria 
1. Users can log in/register before taking a quiz. 
2. Quiz should display MCQs one by one with navigation. 
3. The user gets an instant result after submission (score + pass/fail). 4. Certificate is auto-generated as PDF and downloadable.

5. All data (questions, results, user details) stored in DB. 
6. Deployed on Vercel and fully functional. 
7. Codebase hosted on GitHub with documentation. 
Sub-Tasks 
1. Setup React project with quiz UI and routing. 
2. Design DB schema for Users, Questions, Results. 
3. Implement backend APIs for quiz retrieval and submission. 
4. Build the result screen with score calculation. 
5. Integrate PDF generation (certificate with dynamic details). 
6. Deploy frontend & backend on Vercel. 
7. Write README.md with instructions and screenshots. 
Deliverables 
GitHub Repo (frontend + backend + DB schema). 
Vercel Live Link (working app). 
README.md with setup instructions and screenshots.
